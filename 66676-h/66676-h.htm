<p class="ph1">THE<br />
<span class="large">KING OF THE MAMOZEKEL</span></p>



<h2 class="nobreak">I.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the king of the Mamozekel barrens
was born, he was one of the most
ungainly of all calves,&mdash;a moose-calf.</p>

<p>In the heart of a tamarack swamp,
some leagues south from Nictau Mountain,
was a dry little knoll of hardwood
and pine undiscovered by the hunters,
out of the track of the hunting beasts.
Neither lynx, bear, nor panther had
tradition of it. There was little succulent
undergrowth to tempt the moose
and the caribou. But there the wild
plum each summer fruited abundantly,
and there a sturdy brotherhood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
beeches each autumn lavished their
treasure of three-cornered nuts; and
therefore the knoll was populous with
squirrels and grouse. Nature, in one of
those whims of hers by which she
delights to confound the studious naturalist,
had chosen to keep this spot
exempt from the law of blood and fear
which ruled the rest of her domains. To
be sure, the squirrels would now and then
play havoc with a nest of grouse eggs,
or, in the absence of their chisel-beaked
parents, do murder on a nest of young
golden-wings; but, barring the outbreaks
of these bright-eyed incorrigible marauders,&mdash;bad
to their very toes, and
attractive to their plumy tail-tips,&mdash;the
knoll in the tamarack swamp was a
haven of peace amid the fierce but furtive
warfare of the wilderness.</p>

<p>On this knoll, when the arbutus breath
of the northern spring was scenting the
winds of all the Tobique country, the
king was born,&mdash;a moose-calf more ungainly
and of mightier girth and limb
than any other moose-calf of the Mamozekel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Never had his mother seen such
a one,&mdash;and she a mother of lordly bulls.
He was uncouth, to be sure, in any eyes
but those of his kind,&mdash;with his high
humped fore-shoulders, his long, lugubrious,
overhanging snout, his big ears
set low on his big head, his little eyes
crowded back toward his ears, his long,
big-knuckled legs, and the spindling, lank
diminutiveness of his hindquarters. A
grotesque figure, indeed, and lacking
altogether in that pathetic, infantile winsomeness
which makes even little pigs
attractive. But any one who knew
about moose would have said, watching
the huge baby struggle to his
feet and stand with sturdy legs well
braced, &#8220;There, if bears and bullets miss
him till his antlers get full spread, is the
king of the Mamozekel.&#8221; Now, when
his mother had licked him dry, his coat
showed a dark, very sombre, cloudy,
secretive brown, of a hue to be quite
lost in the shadows of the fir and hemlock
thickets, and to blend consummately with
the colour of the tangled alder trunks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
along the clogged banks of the Mamozekel.</p>

<p>The young king&#8217;s mother was perhaps
the biggest and most morose cow on
all the moose ranges of northern New
Brunswick. She assuredly had no peer
on the barrens of the upper Tobique
country. She was also the craftiest.
That was the reason why, though she
was dimly known and had been blindly
hunted all the way from Nictau Lake,
over Mamozekel, and down to Blue
Mountain on the main Tobique, she had
never felt a bullet wound, and had come
to be regarded by the backwoods hunters
with something of a superstitious awe.
It was of her craft, too, that she had
found this knoll in the heart of the
tamarack swamp, and had guarded the
secret of it from the herds. Hither, at
calving time, she would come by cunningly
twisted trails. Here she would
pass the perilous hours in safety, unharassed
by the need of watching against
her stealthy foes. And when once she
had led her calf away from the retreat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
she never returned to it, save alone, and
in another year.</p>

<p>For three days the great cow stayed
upon the knoll, feeding upon the overhanging
branch tips of mountain-ash and
poplar. This was good fodder, for buds
and twigs were swollen with sap, and
succulent. In those three days her
sturdy young calf made such gains in
strength and stature that he would have
passed in the herd for a calf of two
weeks&#8217; growth. In mid-afternoon of the
third day she led the way down from
the knoll and out across the quaking
glooms of the tamarack swamp. And
the squirrels in the budding branches
chattered shrill derision about their going.</p>

<p>The way led through the deepest and
most perilous part of the swamp; but
the mother knew the safe trail in all its
windings. She knew where the yielding
surface of moss with black pools on
either side was not afloat on fathomless
ooze, but supported by solid earth or
a framework of ancient tree roots. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
shambled onward at a very rapid walk,
which forced the gaunt calf at her heels
to break now and then into the long-striding,
tireless trot which is the heritage
of his race.</p>

<p>For perhaps an hour they travelled.
Then, in a little, partly open glade where
the good sound earth rose up sweet from
the morass, and the mountain-ash, the
viburnum, and the moose-wood grew
thinly, and the ground was starred with
spring blooms,&mdash;painted trillium and
wake-robin, claytonia and yellow dog-tooth
and wind-flower,&mdash;they stopped.
The calf, tired from his first journeying,
nursed fiercely, twitching his absurd stub
of a tail, butting at his mother&#8217;s udder
with such discomforting eagerness that
she had to rebuke him by stepping aside
and interrupting his meal. After several
experiences of this kind he took the hint,
and put curb upon his too robust impatience.
The masterful spirit of a king
is liable to inconvenience its owner if
exercised prematurely.</p>

<p>By this time the pink light of sunset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
was beginning to stain the western
curves of branch and stem and bud,
changing the spring coolness of the
place into a delicate riot of fairy colour
and light, intervolving form. Some
shadows deepened, while others disappeared.
Certain leaves and blossoms
and pale limbs stood out with a clearness
almost startling, suddenly emphasised
by the level rays, while others
faded from view. Though there was no
wind, the changed light gave an effect
of noiseless movement in the glade.
And in the midst of this gathering enchantment
the mother moose set herself
to forage for her own meal.</p>

<p>Selecting a slim young birch-tree,
whose top was thick with twigs and
greening buds, she pushed against it
with her massive chest till it bent nearly
to the ground. Then straddling herself
along it, she held it down securely between
her legs, moved forward till the
succulent top was within easy reach, and
began to browse with leisurely jaws and
selective reachings out of her long, discriminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
upper lip. The calf stood
close by, watching with interest, his legs
sympathetically spread apart, his head
swung low from his big shoulders, his
great ears swaying slowly backward and
forward, not together, but one at a time.
When the mother had finished feeding,
there were no buds, twigs or small
branches left on the birch sapling; and
the sunset colours had faded out of the
glade. With dusk a chilly air breathed
softly through the trees, and the mother
led the way into a clump of thick balsam
firs near the edge of the good ground.
In the heart of the thicket she lay down
for the night, facing away from the
wind; and the calf, quick in perception
as in growth, lay down close beside her
in the same position. He did not know
at the time the significance of the position,
but he had a vague sense of its
importance. He was afterward to learn
that enemies were liable to approach his
lair in the night, and that as long as he
slept with his back to the wind, he could
not be taken unawares. The wind
might be trusted to bring to his marvellous
nostrils timely notice of danger from
the rear; while he could depend upon his
eyes and his spacious, sensitive, unsleeping
ears to warn him of anything ascending
against the wind to attack him
in front.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>At the very first suggestion of morning
the two light sleepers arose. In the
dusk of the fir thicket the hungry calf
made his meal. Then they came forth
into the grayness of the spectral spring
dawn, and the great cow proceeded as
before to breast down a birch sapling
for fodder. Before the sun was fairly
up, they left the glade and resumed their
journey across the swamp.</p>

<p>It was mid-morning of a sweet-aired,
radiant day when they emerged from
the swamp. Now, through a diversified
country of thick forests and open levels,
the mother moose swung forward on an
undeviating trail, perceptible only to herself.
Presently the land began to dip.
Then a little river appeared, winding
through innumerable alders, with here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and there a pond-like expansion full of
young lily-leaves; and the future king
of the Mamozekel looked upon his kingdom.
But he did not recognise it. He
cared nothing for the little river of
alders. He was tired, and very hungry,
and the moment his mother halted he
ran up and nursed vehemently.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Delicately</span> filming with the first
green, and spicy-fragrant, were the young
birch-trees on the slopes about the Mamozekel
water. From tree-top to tree-top,
across the open spaces, the rain-birds
called to each other with long falls of
melody and sweetly insistent iteration.
In their intervals of stillness, which
came from time to time as if by some
secret and preconcerted signal, the hush
was beaded, as it were, with the tender
and leisurely staccatos of the chickadees.
The wild kindreds of the Tobique country
were all happily busy with affairs of
spring.</p>

<p>While the great cow was pasturing on
birch-twigs, the calf rested, with long
legs tucked under him, on the dry, softly
carpeted earth beneath the branches of
a hemlock. At this pleasant pasturage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the mother moose was presently joined
by her calf of the previous season, a
sturdy bull-yearling, which ran up to her
with a pathetic little bleat of delight, as
if he had been very desolate and bewildered
during the days of her strange
absence. The mother received him with
good-natured indifference, and went on
pulling birch-tips. Then the yearling
came over and eyed with curiosity the
resting calf,&mdash;the first moose-calf he
had ever seen. The king, unperturbed
and not troubling himself to rise, thrust
forward his spacious ears, and reached
out a long, inquiring nose to investigate
the newcomer. But the yearling was in
doubt. He drew back, planted his fore
hoofs firmly, and lowered and shook his
head, challenging the stranger to a butting
bout. The old moose, which had
kept wary eye upon the meeting, now
came up and stood over her young,
touching him once or twice lightly with
her upper lip. Then, swinging her great
head to one side, she glanced at the
yearling, and made a soft sound in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
throat. Whether this were warning or
mere pertinent information, the yearling
understood that his smaller kinsman was
to be let alone, and not troubled with
challenges. With easy philosophy, he
accepted the situation, doubtless not concerned
to understand it, and turned his
thoughts to the ever fresh theme of
forage.</p>

<p>Through the spring and summer the
little family of three fed never far from
the Mamozekel stream; and the king
grew with astonishing speed. Of other
moose families they saw little, for the
mother, jealous and overbearing in her
strength, would tolerate no other cows
on her favourite range. Sometimes they
saw a tall bull, with naked forehead,
come down to drink or to pull lily-stems
in the still pools at sunset. But the
bull, feeling himself discrowned and unlordly
in the absence of his antlers, paid
no attention to either cows or calves.
While waiting for autumn to restore to
his forehead its superb palmated adornments,
he was haughty and seclusive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>By the time summer was well established
in the land, the moose-calf had
begun to occupy himself diligently with
the primer-lessons of life. Keeping much
at his mother&#8217;s head, he soon learned to
pluck the tops of tall seeding grasses;
though such low-growing tender herbage
as cattle and horses love, he never
learned to crop. His mother, like all
his tribe, was too long in the legs and
short in the neck to pasture close to the
ground. He was early taught, however,
what succulent pasturage of root and
stem and leaf the pools of Mamozekel
could supply; and early his sensitive
upper lip acquired the wisdom to discriminate
between the wholesome water-plants
and such acrid, unfriendly growths
as the water-parsnip and the spotted cow-bane.
Most pleasant the little family
found it, in the hot, drowsy afternoons,
to wade out into the leafy shallows
and feed at leisure belly-deep in the
cool, with no sound save their own comfortable
splashings, or the shrill clatter
of a kingfisher winging past up-stream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Their usual feeding hours were just before
sunrise, a little before noon, and
again in the late afternoon, till dark.
The rest of the time they would lie hidden
in the deepest thickets, safe, but ever
watchful, their great ears taking in and
interpreting all the myriad fluctuating
noises of the wilderness.</p>

<p>The hours of foraging were also&mdash;for
the young king, in particular, whose food
was mostly provided by his mother&mdash;the
hours of lesson and the hours of
play. In the pride of his growing
strength he quickly developed a tendency
to butt at everything and test
his prowess. His yearling brother was
always ready to meet his desires in this
fashion, and the two would push against
each other with much grunting, till at
last the elder, growing impatient, would
thrust the king hard back upon his
haunches, and turn aside indifferently to
his browsing. Little by little it became
more difficult for the yearling to close
the bout in this easy way; but he never
guessed that in no distant day the contests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
would end in a very different manner.
He did not know that, for a calf
of that same spring, his lightly tolerated
playfellow was big and strong and audacious
beyond all wont of the wide-antlered
kindred.</p>

<p>The young king was always athrill
with curiosity, full of interest in all the
wilderness folk that chanced to come
in his view. The shyest of the furtive
creatures were careless about letting him
see them, both his childishness and his
race being guarantee of good will. Very
soon, therefore, he became acquainted, in
a distant, uncomprehending fashion, with
the hare and the mink, the wood-mouse
and the muskrat; while the mother mallard
would float amid her brood within
a yard or two of the spot where he was
pulling at the water-lilies.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;THE MOTHER MALLARD WOULD FLOAT AMID HER BROOD.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day, however, he came suddenly
upon a porcupine which was crossing
a bit of open ground,&mdash;came upon it so
suddenly that the surly little beast was
startled and rolled himself up into a
round, bristling ball. This was a strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
phenomenon indeed! He blew upon the
ball, two or three hard noisy breaths from
wide nostrils. Then he was so rash as
to thrust at it tentatively rather than
roughly with his inquisitive nose,&mdash;for
he was most anxious to know what it
meant. There was a quiver in the ball;
and he jumped back, shaking his head,
with two of the sharp spines sticking in
his sensitive upper lip.</p>

<p>In pain and fright, yet with growing
anger, he ran to his mother where she
was placidly cropping a willow-top. But
she was not helpful. She knew nothing
of the properties of porcupine quills.
Seeing what was the matter, she set the
example of rubbing her nose smartly
against a stump. The king did likewise.</p>

<p>Now, for burrs, this would have been
all very well; but porcupine quills&mdash;the
malignant little intruders throve
under such treatment, and worked their
way more deeply into the tender tissues.
Smarting and furious, the young monarch
rushed back with the purpose of
stamping that treacherous ball of spines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to fragments under his sharp hoofs.
But the porcupine, meanwhile, had discreetly
climbed a tree, whence it looked
down with scornful red eyes, bristling its
barbed armory, and daring the angry calf
to come up and fight. For days thereafter
the young king suffered from a
nose so hot and swollen that it was hard
for him to browse, and almost impossible
for him to nurse. Then came relief, as
the quills worked their way through, one
dropping out, and the other getting
chewed up with a lily-root. But the
young moose never forgot his grudge
against the porcupine family; and catching
one, years after, in a poplar sapling,
he bore the sapling down and trod his
enemy to bits. In his wrath, however,
he did not forget the powers and properties
of the quills. He took good care
that none should pierce the tender places
of his feet.</p>

<p>Some weeks after his meeting with
the porcupine, when his nose and his
spirits together had quite recovered, he
made a new acquaintance. The moose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
family had by this time worked much
farther up the Mamozekel, into a region
of broken ground, and steep up-thrusts
of rock. One day, while investigating
the world at a little distance from his
mother and brother, he saw a large,
curious-looking animal at the top of a
rocky slope. It was a light brown-gray
in colour, with a big, round face, high-tufted
ears, round, light, cold eyes, long
whiskers brushed back from under its
chin, very long, sharp teeth displayed in
its snarlingly open jaws, and big round
pads of feet. The lynx glared at the
young king, scornfully unacquainted with
his kingship. And the young king
stared at the lynx with lively, unhostile
interest. Then the lynx cast a wary
glance all about, saw no sign of the
mother moose (who was feeding on the
other side of the rock), concluded that
this was such an opportunity as he had
long been looking for, and began creeping
swiftly, stealthily, noiselessly, down the
slope of rocks.</p>

<p>Any other moose-calf, though of thrice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the young king&#8217;s months, would have run
away. But not so he. The stranger
seemed unfriendly. He would try a bout
of butting with him. He stamped his
feet, shook his lowered head, snorted, and
advanced a stride or two. At the same
time, he uttered a harsh, very abrupt,
bleating cry of defiance, the infantile precursor
of what his mighty, forest-daunting
bellow was to be in later years. The
lynx, though he well knew that this
ungainly youngster could not withstand
his onslaught for a moment, was nevertheless
astonished by such a display of
spirit; and he paused for a moment to consider
it. Was it possible that unguessed
resources lay behind this daring? He
would see.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment. A very
few words more would have sufficed
for the conclusion of this chronicle,
but for the fact that the young king&#8217;s
bleat of challenge had reached other ears
than those of the great lynx. The old
moose, at her pasturing behind the rock,
heard it too. Startled and anxious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
she came with a rush to find out what it
meant; and the yearling, full of curiosity,
came at her heels. When she saw the
lynx, the long hair on her neck stood up
with fury, and with a roar she launched
her huge, dark bulk against him. But
for such an encounter the big cat had no
stomach. He knew that he would be
pounded into paste in half a minute.
With a snarl he sprang backward, as if
his muscles had been steel springs suddenly
loosed; and before his assailant was
half-way up the slope, he was glaring
down upon her from the safe height of a
hemlock limb.</p>

<p>This, to the young king, seemed a
personal victory. The mother&#8217;s efforts
to make him understand that lynxes
were dangerous had small effect upon
him; and the experience advanced him
not at all in his hitherto unlearned lesson
of fear.</p>

<p>Even he, however, for all his kingly
heart, was destined to learn that lesson,&mdash;was
destined to have it so seared into
his spirit that the remembrance should,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
from time to time, unnerve, humiliate,
defeat him, through half the years of his
sovereignty.</p>

<p>It came about in this way, one blazing
August afternoon.</p>

<p>The old moose and the yearling were
at rest, comfortably chewing the cud in
a spruce covert close to the water. But
the king was in one of those restless fits
which, all through his calfhood, kept
driving him forward in quest of experience.
The wind was almost still; but
such as there was blew up-stream. Up
against it he wandered for a little way,
and saw nothing but a woodchuck, which
was a familiar sight to him. Then he
turned and drifted carelessly down the
wind. Having passed the spruce thicket,
his nostrils received messages from his
mother and brother in their quiet concealment.
The scent was companion to
him, and he wandered on. Presently it
faded away from the faintly pulsing air.
Still he went on.</p>

<p>Presently he passed a huge, half-decayed
windfall, thickly draped in shrubbery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and vines. No sooner had he
passed than the wind brought him from
this dense hiding-place a pungent, unfamiliar
scent. There was something
ominous in the smell, something at
which his heart beat faster; but he was
not afraid. He stopped at once, and
moved back slowly toward the windfall,
sniffing with curiosity, his ears alert, his
eyes striving to pierce the mysteries of
the thicket.</p>

<p>He moved close by the decaying trunk
without solving the enigma. Then, as
the wind puffed a thought more strongly,
he passed by and lost the scent. At once
he swung about to pursue the investigation;
and at the same instant an intuitive
apprehension of peril made him shudder,
and shrink away from windfall.</p>

<p>He turned not an instant too soon.
What he saw was a huge, black, furry
head and shoulders leaning over the
windfall, a huge black paw, with knife-like
claws, lifting for a blow that would
break his back like a bulrush. He was
already moving, already turning, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
with his muscles gathered. That saved
him. Quick as a flash of light he
sprang, wildly. Just as quickly, indeed,
came down the stroke of those terrific
claws. But they fell short of their intended
mark. As the young moose
sprang into the air, the claws caught him
slantingly on the haunch. They went
deep, ripping hide and flesh almost to
the bone,&mdash;a long, hideous wound. Before
the blow could be repeated, the calf
was far out of reach, bleating with pain
and terror. The bear, much disappointed,
peered after him with little red,
malicious eyes, and greedily licked the
sweet blood from his claws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>The next instant the mother moose
burst from her thicket, the long hair of
her neck and shoulders stiffly erect with
rage. She had understood well enough
that agonised cry of the young king.
She paused but a second, to give him
a hasty lick of reassurance, then charged
down upon the covert around the windfall.
She knew that only a bear could
have done that injury; and she knew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
without any help from ears, eyes, or
nose, that the windfall was just the place
for a bear&#8217;s lying-in-wait. With an intrepidity
beyond the boldest dreams of
any other moose-cow on the Mamozekel,
she launched herself crashing into the
covert.</p>

<p>But her avenging fury found no bear
to meet it. The bear knew well this
mighty moose-cow, having watched her
from many a hiding-place, and shrewdly
estimated her prowess. He had effaced
himself, melting away through the underwood
as noiselessly and swiftly as a
weasel. Plenty of the strong bear scent
the old moose found in the covert, and
it stung her to frenzy. She stamped
and tore down the vines, and sent the
rotten wood of the windfall flying in
fragments. Then she emerged, powdered
with debris, and roared and glared about
for the enemy. But the wily bear was
already far away, well burdened with
discretion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few weeks the king&#8217;s healthy
flesh, assiduously licked by his mother,
healed perfectly, leaving long, hairless
scars upon his hide, which turned, in
course of time, from livid to a leaden
whitish hue. But while his flesh healed
perfectly, his spirit was in a different
case. Thenceforward, one great fear
lurked in his heart, ready to leap forth
at any instant&mdash;the fear of the bear. It
was the only fear he knew, but it was
a terrible one; and when, two months
later, he again caught that pungent scent
in passing a thicket, he ran madly for an
hour before he recovered his wits and
stole back, humiliated and exhausted, to
his mother&#8217;s pasture-grounds.</p>

<p>In the main, however, he was soon his
old, bold, investigating self, his bulk and
his sagacity growing vastly together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Ere the first frosts had crimsoned the
maples and touched the birches to a
shimmer of pale gold, he could almost
hold his own by sheer strength against his
yearling brother&#8217;s weight, and sometimes,
for a minute or two, worst him by feint
and strategy. When he came, by chance,
in the crisp, free-roving weather of the
fall, upon other moose-calves of that
year&#8217;s birth, they seemed pygmies beside
him, and gave way to him respectfully
as to a yearling.</p>

<p>About this time he experienced certain
qualms of loneliness, which bewildered
him and took much of the interest out
of life. His mother began to betray an
unexpected indifference, and his childish
heart missed her caresses. He was not
driven away, but he was left to himself;
while she would stride up and down the
open, gravelly meadows by the water,
sniffing the air, and at times uttering a
short, harsh roar which made him eye
her uneasily. One crisp night, when the
round October moon wrought magic in
the wilderness, he heard his mother&#8217;s call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
answered by a terrific, roaring bellow,
which made his heart leap. Then there
was a crashing through the underbrush;
and a tall bull strode forth into the light,
his antlers spreading like oak branches
from either side of his forehead. Prudence,
or deference, or a mixture of the
two, led the young king to lay aside his
wonted inquisitiveness and withdraw
into the thickets without attracting the
notice of this splendid and formidable
visitor. During the next few days he
saw the big bull very frequently, and
found himself calmly ignored. Prudence
and deference continued their good
offices, however, and he was careful not
to trespass on the big stranger&#8217;s tolerance
during those wild, mad, magical autumn
days.</p>

<p>One night, about the middle of October,
the king saw from his thicket a
scene which filled him with excitement
and awe, swelled his veins almost to
bursting, and made his brows ache,
as if the antlers were already pushing to
birth beneath the skin. It all came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
about in this fashion. His mother,
standing out in the moonlight by the
water, had twice with outstretched muzzle
uttered her call, when it was answered
not only by her mate, the tall bull, approaching
along the shore, but by another
great voice from up the hillside. Instantly
the tall bull was in a rage. He
rushed up to the cow, touched her with
his nose, and then, after a succession of
roars which were answered promptly
from the hillside, he moved over to the
edge of the open and began thrashing
the bushes with his antlers. A great
crashing of underbrush arose some distance
away, and drew near swiftly; and
in a few minutes another bull burst forth
violently into the open. He was young
and impetuous, or he would have halted
a moment before leaving cover, and
stealthily surveyed the situation. But
not yet had years and overthrows taught
him the ripe moose wisdom; and with
a reckless heart he committed himself to
the combat.</p>

<p>The newcomer had barely the chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
to see where he was, before the tall bull
was upon him. He wheeled in time,
however, and got his guard down; but
was borne back upon his haunches by
the terrific shock of the charge. In a
moment or two he recovered the lost
ground, for youth had given him
strength, if not wisdom; and the tall
bull, his eyes flame-red with wrath, found
himself fairly matched by this shorter,
stockier antagonist.</p>

<p>The night forthwith became tempestuous
with gruntings, bellowings, the hard
clashing of antlers, the stamping of swift
and heavy feet. The thin turf was torn
up. The earthy gravel was sent flying
from the furious hoofs. From his covert
the young king strained eager eyes upon
the fight, his sympathies all with the tall
bull whom he had regarded reverently
from the first moment he saw him. But
as for the cow, she moved up from the
waterside and looked on with a fine
impartiality. What concerned her was
chiefly that none but the bravest and
strongest should be her mate,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
question which only fighting could determine.
Her favour would go with
victory.</p>

<p>As it appeared, the rivals were fairly
matched in vigour and valour. But
among moose, as among men, brains
count in the end. When the tall bull
saw that, in a matter of sheer brawn,
the sturdy stranger might hold him, he
grew disgusted at the idea of settling
such a vital question by mere butting
and shoving. The red rage faded in
his eyes, and a colder light took its
place. On a sudden, when his foe had
given a mighty thrust, he yielded, slipped
his horns from the lock, and jumped
nimbly aside. The stranger lunged forward,
almost stumbling to his knees.</p>

<p>This was the tall bull&#8217;s opportunity.
In a whirlwind of fury he thrust upon
the enemy&#8217;s flank, goring him, and bearing
him down. The latter, being short
and quick-moving, recovered his feet in
a second, and wheeled to present his
guard. But the tall bull was quick to
maintain the advantage. He, too, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
shifted ground; and now he caught his
antagonist in the rear. There was no
resisting such an attack. With hind
legs weakly doubling under him, with
the weight of doom descending upon his
defenceless rump, the rash stranger was
thrust forward, bellowing madly, and
striving in vain to brace himself. His
humiliation was complete. With staring
eyes and distended nostrils he was
hustled across the meadow and over the
edge of the bank. With a huge splash,
and carrying with him a shower of
turf and gravel, he fell into the stream.
Once in the water, and his courage well
cooled, he did not wait for a glance at
his snorting and stamping conqueror on
the bank above, but waded desperately
across, dripping, bleeding, crushed in
spirit,&mdash;and vanished into the woods.
In the thicket, the king&#8217;s heart swelled as
if the victory had been his own.</p>

<p>By and by, when the last of the leaves
had fluttered down with crisp whisperings
from the birch and ash, maple and
poplar, and the first enduring snows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
were beginning to change the face of
the world, the tall bull seemed to lay
aside his haughtiness. He grew carelessly
good-natured toward the young
king and the yearling, and frankly took
command of the little herd. As the
snow deepened, he led the way northward
toward the Nictau Lake and chose
winter quarters on the wooded southward
slopes of Bald Mountain, where
there were hemlock groves for shelter
and an abundance of young hardwood
growth for browsing.</p>

<p>This leisurely migration was in the
main uneventful, and left but one sharp
impression on the young king&#8217;s memory.
On a wintry morning, when the sunrise
was reaching long pink-saffron fingers
across the thin snow, a puff of wind
brought with it from a tangle of stumps
and rocks a breath of that pungent scent
so hateful to a moose&#8217;s nostrils. The
whole herd stopped; and the young king,
his knees quaking under him and his
eyes staring with panic, crowded close
against his mother&#8217;s flank. The tall bull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
stamped and bellowed his defiance to the
enemy,&mdash;but the enemy, being discreet,
made no reply whatever. It is probable,
indeed, that he was preparing his winter
quarters, and getting too drowsy to hear
or heed the angry challenge; but if he
did hear it no doubt he noiselessly withdrew
himself till the dangerous travellers
had gone by. In a few minutes the herd
resumed its march,&mdash;the king keeping
close to his mother&#8217;s side, instead of in
his proper place in the line.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;THICK PILED THE SNOWS ABOUT THE LITTLE HERD.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>The big-antlered bull now chose his
site for the &#8220;yard,&#8221; with &#8220;verge and room
enough&#8221; for all contingencies. The
&#8220;yard&#8221; was an ample acreage of innumerable
winding paths, trodden ever
deeper as the snows accumulated. These
paths led to every spot of browse, every
nook of shelter, at the same time twisting
and crossing in a maze of intricacies.
Thick piled the snows about the little
herd, and the northern gales roared over
the hemlocks, and the frost sealed the
white world down into silence. But it was
such a winter as the moose kin loved. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
wolves or hunters came to trouble them,
and the months passed pleasantly. When
the days were lengthening and the hearts
of all the wild folks beginning to dream of
the yet unsignalled spring, the young
king was astonished to see the great
antlers of his leader fall off. Seeing
that their owner left them lying unregarded
on the snow, he went up and
sniffed at them wonderingly, and pondered
the incident long and vainly in
his heart.</p>

<p>When the snows shrank away, departing
with a sound of many waters, and
spring returned to the Tobique country,
the herd broke up. First the dis-antlered
bull drifted off on his own affairs. Then
the two-year-old went, with no word of
reason or excuse. Though a well-grown
young bull, he was now little larger or
heavier than the king; and the king was
now a yearling, with the stature and
presence of a two-year-old. In a playful
butting contest, excited by the joy of life
which April put into their veins, he
worsted his elder brother; and this, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
though taken in good part, hastened
the latter&#8217;s going.</p>

<p>A few days later the old cow grew
restless. She and the king turned their
steps backward toward the Mamozekel,
feeding as they went. Soon they found
themselves in their old haunts, which the
king remembered very well. Then one
day, while the king slept without suspicion
of evil, the old cow slipped away stealthily,
and sought her secret refuge in the heart
of the cedar swamp. When the king
awoke, he found himself alone in the
thicket.</p>

<p>All that day he was most unhappy.
For some hours he could not eat, but
strayed hither and thither, questing and
wondering. Then, when hunger drove
him to browse on the tender birch-twigs,
he would stop every minute or two to call
in his big, gruff, pathetic bleat, and look
around eagerly for an answer. No
answer came from the deserting mother,
by this time far away in the swamp.</p>

<p>But there were ears in the wilderness
that heard and heeded the call of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
desolate yearling. A pair of hunting
lynxes paused at the sound, licked their
chops, and crept forward with a green
light in their wide, round eyes.</p>

<p>Their approach was noiseless as
thought,&mdash;but the king, on a sudden,
felt a monition of their coming. Whirling
sharply about, he saw them lurking
in the underbrush. He recognised the
breed. This was the same kind of creature
which he had been ready to challenge
in his first calfhood. No doubt, it
would have been more prudent for him
to withdraw; but he was in no mood for
concession. His sore heart made him
ill-tempered. His lonely bleat became
a bellow of wrath. He stamped the
earth, shook his head as if thrashing
the underbrush with imaginary antlers,
and then charged madly upon the astonished
cats. This was no ordinary moose-calf,
they promptly decided; and in a
second they were speeding away with
great bounds, gray shadows down the
gray vistas of the wood. The king
glared after them for a moment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
then went back to his feeding, greatly
comforted.</p>

<p>It was four days before his mother
came back, bringing a lank calf at her
heels. He was glad to see her, and contentedly
renewed the companionship; but
in those four days he had learned full
self-reliance, and his attitude was no
longer that of the yearling calf. It had
become that of the equal. As for the
lank little newcomer, he viewed it with
careless complaisance, and no more
dreamed of playing with it than if it had
been a frog or a chipmunk.</p>

<p>The summer passed with little more
event for the king than his swift increase
in stature. One lesson then learned,
however, though but vaguely comprehended
at the time, was to prove of
incalculable value in after years. He
learned to shun man,&mdash;not with fear,
indeed, for he never learned to fear anything
except bears,&mdash;but with aversion,
and a certain half-disdainful prudence.
It was as if he came to recognise in man
the presence of powers which he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
anxious to put to trial, lest he should be
forced to doubt his own supremacy.</p>

<p>It was but a slight incident that gave
him the beginning of this valuable wisdom.
As he lay ruminating one day
beside his mother and the gaunt calf, in
a spruce covert near the water, a strange
scent was wafted in to his nostrils. It
carried with it a subtle warning. His
mother touched him with her nose, conveying
a silent yet eloquent monition,
and got upon her feet with no more
sound than if she had been compact of
thistle-down. From their thicket shelter
the three stared forth, moveless and unwinking,
ears forward, nostrils wide.
Then a canoe with two men came into
view, paddling lazily, and turning to
land. To the king, they looked not dangerous;
but every detail of them&mdash;their
shape, motion, colour, and, above all,
their ominous scent&mdash;stamped itself in
his memory. Then, to his great surprise,
his mother silently signalled the
gravest and most instant menace, and
forthwith faded back through the thicket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
with inconceivably stealthy motion. The
king and the calf followed with like care,&mdash;the
king, though perplexed, having
faith in his mother&#8217;s wise woodcraft.
Not until they had put good miles between
themselves and strange-smelling
newcomers did the old moose call a
halt; and from all this precaution the
king realised that the mysterious
strangers were something to be avoided
by moose.</p>

<p>That summer the king saw nothing
more of the man-creatures,&mdash;and he
crossed the scent of no more bears. His
great heart, therefore, found no check
to its growing arrogance and courage.
When the month of the falling leaves
and the whirring partridge-coveys again
came round, he felt a new pugnacity
swelling in his veins, and found himself
uttering challenges, he knew not why,
with his yet half infantile bellow.
When, at length, his mother began to
pace the open meadow by the Mamozekel,
and startle the moonlit silences
with her mating call, he was filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
strange anger. But this was nothing to
his rage when the calls were answered
by a wide-antlered bull. This time the
king refused to slink obsequiously to
cover. He waited in the open; and
he eyed the new wooer in a fashion so
truculent that at length he attracted
notice.</p>

<p>For his dignity, if not for his experience,
this was most unfortunate. The
antlered stranger noted his size, his attitude
of insolence, and promptly charged
upon him. He met the charge, in his
insane audacity, but was instantly borne
down. As he staggered to his feet he
realised his folly, and turned to withdraw,&mdash;not
in terror, but in acknowledgment
of superior strength. Such
a dignified retreat, however, was not to
be allowed him. The big bull fell upon
him again, prodding him cruelly. He
was hustled ignominiously across the
meadow, and into the bushes. Thence
he fled, bleating with impotent wrath and
shame.</p>

<p>In his humiliation he fled far down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
along the river, through alder swamps
which he had never traversed, by pools
in which he had never pulled the lilies.
Onward he pressed, intent on placing
irrevocably behind him the scene of his
chagrin.</p>

<p>At length he came out upon the
fair river basin where the Mamozekel,
the Serpentine, and the Nictau, tameless
streams, unite to form the main Tobique.
Here he heard the call of a young cow,&mdash;a
voice thinner and higher than his
mother&#8217;s deep-chested notes. With an
impulse that he did not understand, he
pushed forward to answer the summons,
no longer furtive, but noisily trampling
the brush. Just then, however, a pungent
smell stung his nostrils. There,
not ten paces distant, was a massive
black shape standing out in the moonlight.
Panic laid grip upon his heart,
chilling every vein. He wheeled, splashed
across the shallow waters of the Nictau,
and fled away northward on tireless
feet.</p>

<p>That winter the king yarded alone, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
a morose old bull, far from his domain of
the Mamozekel. In the spring he came
back, but restricted his range to the neighbourhood
of the Forks. And he saw his
mother no more.</p>

<p>That summer he grew his first antlers.
As antlers, indeed, they were no great
thing; but they started out bravely, a
massive cylindrical bar thrusting forth
laterally, unlike the pointing horns of
deer and caribou, from either side of his
forehead. For all this sturdy start, their
spiking and palmation did not amount
to much; but he was inordinately proud
of them, rubbing off the velvet with care
when it began to itch, and polishing
assiduously at the hardened horn. By
the time the October moon had come
round again to the Tobique country, he
counted these first antlers a weapon for
any encounter; and, indeed, with his
bulk and craft behind them, they were
formidable.</p>

<p>It was not long before they were put
to the test. One night, as he stood
roaring and thrashing the bushes on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
bluff overlooking the Forks, he heard
the call of a young cow a little way down
the shore. Gladly he answered. Gladly
he sped to the tryst. Strange ecstasies,
the madness of the night spell, and the
white light&#8217;s sorcery made his heart beat
and his veins run sweet fire. But suddenly
all this changed; for another roar,
a taunting challenge, answered him; and
another bull broke from covert on the
other side of the sandy level where stood
the young cow coquettishly eyeing both
wooers.</p>

<p>The new arrival was much older than
the king and nobly antlered; but in matter
of inches the young king was already
his peer. In craft, arrogance, and self-confident
courage the king had an
advantage that outweighed the deficiency
in antlers. The fury of his charge
spelled victory from the first; and though
the battle was prolonged, the issue was
decided at the outset, as the interested
young cow soon perceived. In about
a half-hour it was all over. The wise
white moon of the wilderness looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
down understandingly upon the furrowed
sandspit, the pleased young cow, and the
king making diffident progress with his
first wooing. Some distance down
the river-bank, she caught glimpses of
the other bull, whose antlers had not
saved him, fleeing in shame, with bleeding
flanks and neck, through the light-patched
shadows of the forest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the next four years the king
learned to grow such antlers as had
never before been seen in all the Tobique
country. So tall, impetuous, and
masterful he grew, that the boldest bulls,
recognising the vast reverberations of
his challenge, would smother their wrath
and slip noiselessly away from his neighbourhood.
Rumours of his size and
his great antlers in some way got
abroad among the settlements; but so
crafty was he in shunning men,&mdash;whom
he did not really fear, and whom he was
wont to study intently from safe coverts,&mdash;that
there was never a hunter who
could boast of having got a shot at
him.</p>

<p>Once, and once only, did he come into
actual, face to face conflict with the
strange man-creature. It was one autumn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
evening, at the first of the season.
By the edge of a little lake, he heard the
call of a cow. Having already found
a mate, he was somewhat inattentive,
and did not answer; but something
strange in the call made him suspicious,
and he stole forward, under cover, to
make an observation. The call was
repeated, seeming to come from a little,
rushy island, a stone&#8217;s throw from shore.
This time there came an answer,&mdash;not
from the king, but from an eager bull
rushing up from the outlet of the lake.
The king listened, with some lazy interest,
to the crashing and slashing of the
impetuous approach, thinking that if the
visitor were big enough to be worth
while he would presently go out and
thrash him. When the visitor did appear,
however, bursting from the underbrush
and striding boldly down to the
water&#8217;s edge, a strange thing happened.
From the rushy island came a spurt of
flame, a sharp detonating report. The
bull jumped and wheeled in his tracks.
Another report, and he dropped without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
a kick. As he lay in the pale light, close
to the water, a canoe shot out from the
rushy island and landed some distance
from the body. Two men sprang out.
They pulled up the canoe, leaving their
rifles in it, and ran up to skin the prize.</p>

<p>The king in his hiding-place understood.
This was what men could do,&mdash;make
a strange, menacing sound, and
kill moose with it. He boiled with
rage at this exhibition of their power,
and suddenly took up the quarrel of
the slain bull. But by no means did
he lay aside his craft. Noiselessly he
moved, a vast and furtive shadow, down
through the thickets to a point where
the underbrush nearly touched the water.
This brought him within a few yards of
the canoe, wherein the hunters had left
their rifles. Here he paused a few
moments, pondering. But as he pondered,
redder and redder grew his eyes;
and suddenly, with a mad roar, he burst
from cover and charged.</p>

<p>Had the two men not been expert
woodsmen, one or the other would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
been caught and smashed to pulp. But
their senses were on the watch. Cut off
as they were from the canoe and from
their weapons, their only hope was a
tree. Before the king was fairly out
into view, they had understood the whole
situation, sprung to their feet, and sped
off like hares. Just within the nearest
fringe of bushes grew a low-hanging
beech-tree; and into this they swung
themselves, just as the king came raging
beneath. As it was, one of them was
nearly caught when he imagined himself
quite safe. The king reared his mighty
bulk against the trunk and with his
keen-spiked antlers reached upward
fiercely after the fugitives, the nearest
of whom was saved only by a friendly
branch which intervened.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour the king stamped
and stormed beneath the branches, while
the trapped hunters alternately cursed
his temper and wondered at his stature.
Then, with a swift change of purpose, he
wheeled and charged on the canoe. In
two minutes the graceful craft was reduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
to raw material, while the hunters
in the tree-top, sputtering furiously,
vowed vengeance. All the kit, the tins,
the blankets, the boxes, were battered
shapeless, and the rifles thumped well
down into the wet sand. In the midst
of the cataclysm, one of the rifles somehow
went off. The noise and the flash
astonished the king, but only added to
his rage and made him more thorough
in his work of destruction. When there
was nothing left that seemed worth
trampling upon, he returned to the tree,&mdash;on
which he had kept eye all the time,&mdash;and
there nursed his wrath all night.
At the first of dawn, however, he came
to the conclusion that the shivering
things in the tree were not worth
waiting for. He swung off, and sought
his favourite pasturage, a mile or two
away; and the men, after making sure
of his departure, climbed down. They
nervously cut some steaks from the bull
which they had killed, and hurried away,
crestfallen, on the long tramp back to
the settlements.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>This incident, however, did not have
the effect which it might have been expected
to have. It did not make the
king despise men. On the contrary, he
now knew them to be dangerous, and
he also knew that their chief power lay
in the long dark tubes which spit fire and
made fierce sounds. It was enough for
him that he had once worsted them.
Ever afterward he gave them wide berth.
And the tradition of him would have
come at last to be doubted in the settlements,
but for the vast, shed antlers
occasionally found lying on the diminished
snows of March.</p>

<p>But all the time, while the king waxed
huge and wise, and overthrew his enemies,
and begot great offspring that, for
many years after he was dead, were to
make the Mamozekel famous, there was
one grave incompleteness in his sovereignty.
His old panic fear of bears still
shamed and harassed him. The whiff of
a harmless half-grown cub, engrossed in
stuffing its greedy red mouth with blueberries,
was enough to turn his blood to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
water and send him off to other feeding-grounds.
He chose his ranges, indeed,
first of all for their freedom from the
dreaded taint, and only second for the
excellence of their pasturage. This one
unreasoning fear was the drop of gall
which went far toward embittering all
the days of his singularly favoured life.
It was as if the wood-gods, after endowing
him so far beyond his fellows, had
repented of their lavishness, and capriciously
poisoned their gifts.</p>

<p>One autumn night, just at the beginning
of the calling season, this weakness
of his betrayed the king to the deepest
humiliation which had ever befallen him.
He was then nearly seven years old; and
because his voice was known to every
bull in the Tobique country, there was
never answer made when his great challenge
went stridently resounding over
the moonlit wastes. But on this particular
night, when he had roared perhaps
for his own amusement, or for the
edification of his mate, who browsed near
by, rather than with any expectation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
response, to his astonishment there came
an answering defiance from the other
side of the open. A big, wandering bull,
who had strayed up from the Grand
River region, had never heard of the
king, and was more than ready to put
his valour to test. The king rushed to
meet him. Now it chanced that between
the approaching giants was an
old ash-tree growing out of a thicket.
In this thicket a bear had been grubbing
for roots. When he heard the
king&#8217;s first roar, he started to steal away
from the perilous proximity; but the
second bull&#8217;s answer, from the direction
in which he had hoped to retreat, stopped
him. In much perturbation he climbed
the ash-tree to a safe distance, and curled
himself into a black, furry ball, in a fork
of the branches.</p>

<p>The night was still, and no scents wafting
to sensitive nostrils. With short roars,
and much thrashing of the underbrush,
the two bulls drew near. When the king
was just about abreast of the bear&#8217;s
hiding-place, his arrogance broke into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
fury, and he charged upon the audacious
stranger. Just as he did so, and just as
his foe sprang to meet him, a wilful
night-wind puffed lightly through the
branches. It was a very small, irresponsible
wind; but it carried sharply to the
king&#8217;s nostrils the strong, fresh taint of
bear.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_71.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;WAS OFF THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH IN IGNOMINIOUS FLIGHT.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>The smell was so strong, it seemed to
the king as if the bear must be fairly
on his haunches. It was like an icy
cataract flung upon him. He shrank,
trembled,&mdash;and the old wounds twinged
and cringed. The next moment, to the triumphant
amazement of his antagonist, he
had wheeled aside to avoid the charge, and
was off through the underbrush in ignominious
flight. The newcomer, who,
for all his stout-heartedness, had viewed
with concern the giant bulk of his foe,
stopped short in his tracks and stared
in bewilderment. So easy a victory as
this was beyond his dreams,&mdash;even beyond
his desires. However, a bull moose
can be a philosopher on occasion, and
this one was not going to quarrel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
good luck. In high elation he strode on
up the meadow, and set himself, not unsuccessfully,
to wooing the deserted and
disgusted cow.</p>

<p>His triumph, however, was short-lived.
About moonrise of the following night
the king came back. He was no longer
thinking of bears, and his heart was full
of wrath. His vast challenge came down
from the near-by hills, making the night
resound with its short, explosive thunders.
His approach was accompanied by
the thrashing of giant antlers on the
trees, and by a crashing as if the under-growths
were being trodden by a locomotive.
There was grim omen in the
sounds; and the cow, waving her great
ears back and forward thoughtfully, eyed
the Grand River bull with shrewd interest.
The stranger showed himself
game, no whit daunted by threatenings
and thunder. He answered with brave
roarings, and manifested every resolution
to maintain his conquest. But
sturdy and valorous though he was, all
his prowess went for little when the king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
fell upon him, thrice terrible from the
memory of his humiliation. There was
no such thing as withstanding that awful
charge. Before it the usurper was
borne back, borne down, overwhelmed,
as if he had been no more than a yearling
calf. He had no chance to recover.
He was trampled and ripped and thrust
onward, a helpless sprawl of unstrung
legs and outstretched, piteous neck. It
was luck alone,&mdash;or some unwonted
kindness of the wood-spirits,&mdash;that saved
his life from being trodden and beaten
out in that hour of terror. It was close
to the river-bank that he had made his
stand; and presently, to his great good
fortune, he was thrust over the brink.
He fell into the water with a huge
splash. When he struggled to his feet,
and moved off, staggering, down the
shallow edges of the stream, the king
looked over and disdained to follow up
the vengeance.</p>

<p>Fully as he had vindicated himself,
the king was never secure against such
a humiliation so long as he rested thrall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to his one fear. The threat of the bear
hung over him, a mystery of terror
which he could not bring himself to
face. But at last, and in the season
of his weakness, when he had shed his
antlers, there came a day when he was
forced to face it. Then his kingliness
was put to the supreme trial.</p>

<p>He was now at the age of nine years,
in the splendour of his prime. He stood
over seven feet high at the shoulders,
and weighed perhaps thirteen hundred
pounds. His last antlers, those which
he had shed two months before, had
shown a gigantic spread of nearly six
feet.</p>

<p>It was late April. Much honeycombed
snow and ice still lingered in
the deeper hollows. After a high fashion
of his own, seldom followed among the
moose of the Tobique region, the king
had rejoined his mate when she emerged
from her spring retreat with a calf at her
flank. He was too lordly in spirit to
feel cast down or discrowned when his
head was shorn of its great ornament;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and he never felt the spring moroseness
which drives most bull moose into seclusion.
He always liked to keep his little
herd together, was tolerant to the yearlings,
and even refrained from driving
off the two-year-olds until their own
aggressiveness made it necessary.</p>

<p>On this particular April day, the king
was bestriding a tall poplar sapling,
which he had borne down that he might
browse upon its tender, sap-swollen tips.
By the water&#8217;s edge the cow and the
yearling were foraging on the young
willow shoots. The calf, a big-framed,
enterprising youngster two weeks old,
almost as fine a specimen of young
moosehood as the king had been at
his age, was poking about curiously to
gather knowledge of the wilderness
world. He approached a big gray-white
boulder, whose base was shrouded in
spruce scrub, and sniffed apprehensively
at a curious, pungent taint that came
stealing out upon the air.</p>

<p>He knew by intuition that there was
peril in that strange scent; but his interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
overweighed his caution, and he
drew close to the spruce scrub. Close,
and yet closer; and his movement was
so unusual that it attracted the attention
of the king, who stopped browsing to
watch him intently. A vague, only half-realised
memory of that far-off day when
he himself, a lank calf of the season,
went sniffing curiously at a thicket,
stirred in his brain; and the stiff hair
along his neck and shoulder began to
bristle. He released the poplar sapling,
and turned all his attention to the behaviour
of the calf.</p>

<p>The calf was very close to the green
edges of the spruce scrub, when he
caught sight of a great dark form
within, which had revealed itself by a
faint movement. More curious than
ever, but now distinctly alarmed, he
shrank back, turning at the same time,
as if to investigate from another and
more open side of the scrub.</p>

<p>The next instant a black bulk lunged
forth with incredible swiftness from the
green, and a great paw swung itself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
a circular, sweeping motion, upon the
retreating calf. In the wilderness world,
as in the world of men, history has a
trick of repeating itself; and this time,
as on that day nine years before, the
bear was just too late. The blow did
not reach its object till most of its force
was spent. It drew blood, and knocked
the calf sprawling, but did no serious
damage. With a bleat of pain and terror,
the little animal jumped to its feet
and ran away.</p>

<p>The bear would have easily caught
him before he could recover himself;
but another and very different voice had
answered the bleat of the calf. At the
king&#8217;s roar of fury the bear changed his
plans and slunk back into hiding. In
a moment the king came thundering up
to the edge of the spruces. There,
planting his fore-feet suddenly till they
ploughed the ground, he stopped himself
with a mighty effort. The smell of the
bear had smitten him in the face.</p>

<p>The moment was a crucial one. The
pause was full of fate. Turning his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
head in indecision, he caught a cry of
pain from the calf as it ran to its
mother; and he saw the blood streaming
down its flank. Then the kingliness
of his heart arose victorious. With a
roar, he breasted trampling into the
spruce scrub, heedless at last of the
dreaded scent.</p>

<p>The bear, meanwhile, had been seeking
escape. He had just emerged on
the other side of the spruces, and was
slipping off to find a secure tree. As
the king thundered down upon him, he
wheeled with a savage growl, half
squatted back, and struck out sturdily
with that redoubtable paw. But at the
same instant the king&#8217;s edged hoofs
came down upon him with the impact
of a battering-ram. They smashed in
his ribs. They tore open his side.
They hurled him over so that his belly
was exposed. He was at a hopeless disadvantage.
He had not an instant for
recovery. Those avenging hoofs, with
the power of a pile-driver behind them,
smote like lightning. The bear struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
savagely, twice, thrice; and his claws
tore their way through hide and muscle
till the king&#8217;s blood gushed scarlet over
his prostrate foe&#8217;s dark fur. Then the
growls and the claw-strokes ceased; and
the furry shape lay still, outstretched,
unresisting.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the king drew
off, and eyed the carcass. Then the remembrance
of all his past terror and
shame surged hotly through him. He
pounced again upon the body, and
pounded it, and trampled it, and ground
it down, till the hideous mass bore no
longer a resemblance to anything that
ever carried the breath of life. It was
not his enemy only, not only the assailant
of the helpless calf, that he was thus
completely blotting from existence, but it
was fear itself that he was wiping out.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_81.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;IT WAS FEAR ITSELF THAT HE WAS WIPING OUT.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>At last, grown suddenly tired of rage,
and somewhat faint from the red draining
of his veins, the king turned away
and sought his frightened herd. They
gathered about him, trembling with excitement,&mdash;the
light-coated cow, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
dark yearling, the lank, terrified calf.
They stretched thin noses toward him,
questioning, wondering, troubled at his
hot, streaming wounds. But the king
held his head high, heeding neither the
wounds nor the herd. He cast one long,
proud look up the valley of the Mamozekel,
his immediate, peculiar domain.
Then he looked southward over the
lonely Serpentine, northward across the
dark-wooded Nictau, and westward down
the flood of the full, united stream. He
felt himself supreme now beyond challenge
over all the wild lands of Tobique.</p>

<p>For a long time the group stood so,
breathing at last quietly, still with that
stillness which the furtive kindreds
know. There was no sound save the
soft, ear-filling roar of the three rivers,
swollen with freshet, rushing gladly to
their confluence. The sound was as a
background to the cool, damp silence of
the April wilderness. Some belated
snow in a shaded hollow close at hand
shrank and settled with a hushed, evasive
whisper. Then the earliest white-throat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
from the top of a fir-tree, fluted
across the pregnant spring solitudes the
six clear notes of his musical and melancholy
call.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
